# national-forest-certificate-stealer

I bought somebody a tree.

I noticed that the certificate you get from purchasing the tree, had an id at the end of the URL (i.e. https://www.nationalforest.org/generate_certificate/2593)

I started looking at other peoples certificates, there were some right belters.

It was hassle tho, so i wrote this to scrape them all.
